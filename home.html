        <p> For many, the idea of going back to school while working a full time job can daunting.
              Handling a full time job and your studies 
              at the same time requires a good level of planning and prioritisation.
              While some students would choose not to work while furthering their education,there is a massive group of students who
              are balancing a job while studing. There are various reasons for this but, generally speaking, money is key.
              Studying while working gives you the confidence you need as you have financial control 
              as a student. At the same time, the professional qualifications that you can acqire over
              time will give you a good head start in developing your career.

              <p><b> To help you juggle your two lives with the breeze, here are 5 top tips on how to study 
                while working.</b>
                  </p>
            </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Create a plan</b></li>
            <p>At the start of every semister, get all your syllable and record all 
                the examination schedule along with the deadlines for the papers required.

            </p>
            <p> Use a different marker for each of your classes to easily see when
                these due date are coming up for every course.
                Likewise make sure to make any company meetings or work deadlines you may know
                of in your planner.
            </p>
            <li><b> Update yur employer</b>
                <p>
                    Assure your employer that you can manage your work schedules.
                    It is also a way to get their attention, and consider you to be eger to work
                    for them. If possible sacrifice holidays and breaks to show that you are serious about your job.
                    If you prove your dedication, it would be easy to negotiate with them a more study-friendly schedule.
                     
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b> Use your free time productively</b>
             <p>
                If you are studying and working at the same time, it may seem that you 
                have no free time at all.
                However, its important that you use the free time that you do have constuctively
                as this will help you balnce your day job and course work more effectively.
                Forexaple, you can read a book on the way to work if you are commuter. Also use 
                a few minutes of your lunch or break time to study.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li><b> Look after your self</b>
            <p>
                Having a heavy work schedule and studying will inevitably cause you to stess
                out every now and then.
                Therefore, you should be able to handle your stress in a positive way.
                Exercise at the gym or go for a walk a couple of times a week, because physical exercise 
                is an effective stress reliver.
                You can listen to music, write in a journal, have a massage, go to the salon, etc.
                Try to devote at least 30 minutes of your day to doing something you enjoy
                as a way to reduce stress.

            </p></li>
            <li><b>Don't over do it </b>
            <p>
                Be realistic about the time you need to spend sudying and working.
                If you think you can only take one study course at a time together with 
                your workload, then focus on that coure.
                For example if you are studying to become an accountant you may want to 
                take the AAT course first before you look at the other options.
                If you work full-time, determine exactly how many classes you can take for 
                every semister.
                When if comes to work or study, people tend to bite off more that they can chew
                Having a full-time job in any industry can have its  challenges and expectations.
                If you add education to an already busy schedule, it will just increase the amount of 
                pressure
