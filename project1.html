      <div class="col-9">
      <p>Hello! My name is Arsema and i have started studing with the <a href="https://www.refactory.ug"> Refactory </a> at the 
      biginnig of May.
      My main reason for begining this course is that i want to change career path.
      I realized before i began the classes that it could be challenging but i said to my self
      I can start now and see where it leads me. If it leads me to a new career good, if not 
      at least I tryed and knowledge is power so i will gain that.
      So no matter what, I will not waste my time and money. <br><br>
      My first month of the course was good and overwhelming at the same time. 
     
      I know what you are thinking "overwhelming", but with work and family it has been hard.
      I never work and study before so it was all new to me, 
      at the same time at work there could be any urgent things to do. So I have to priortise it.
      But it is always good to challenge your self, for the sake of your future.
     <br><br>
      The classes were  very good and enjoyable.<span id="dots">....</span><span id="more">
       Our teacher let us interact and ask quetions so that was 
      helpful, they also provide all the necessary links or websites.
      The first course was about html, css, version control and git and so on.
      I attended most of the classes but i usually did't find time to do perosnal research on the lessons.
      <br> The lessons are not hard they look simple and practical, the problem starts when I 
       use them together to build a specific page.
        So the personal research and practice becomes handy because no matter how many times we learn 
        it will not be useful unless we practice.

      <p> Work and Study
        This was my first time studying while working, and it has been years since i finish school.
        So it has been difficult. But with the right attitude and strategy I am able to do it. <br>
        The first thing i did was create a plan, like most of the time or my priority is my 
        job and at the same time i need to make time for studying . so the best thing to do is minimize
        leisure time. It is not fun but it's worth it.
        The secound thing I did was let my employer know, not only that I am studying but also that
        I am capable to do both and to be available at all times.
        <span id="dots">....</span><span id="more">
       
        When you sit or stay indoors all day, it can be bad for your health.
        So its good to exercise or take a walk.
        I also a good music, it can help me relax.
        Taking a break once in a while is also good, even if I have alots of things to do 
        I like to take a break and relax, and whne you return to your work or classes 
        you will have a fresh mind .
         Always knowing your limits is also good. For instance I recently had very busy schedule at work 
         and I skip meals and slept late.  And the next days I was very week and I went to the hospital.
         Gladly I was ok , but sometimes its good to know and plan the things you can do and you leave the things you can"t.
